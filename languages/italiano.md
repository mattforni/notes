## The absolute superlative
The ending `-issimo` is added to adjectives in order to express the *highest* level of that attribute or characteristic. This is known as **the absolute superlative**.

The form of the absolute superlative used modulates the end of the superlative to match the gender and number of the noun being described.

```
Questo porto e buonisimo.
Vivono in centro perch√© sono ricchissimi.
```

Where the plural of the adjective ending in `co` becomes `chi`, you add an `h` in the superlative as well.

```
antico - antichissimo
lungo - lunghissimo
```

It's also possible to use the form `molto (very) + adjective` instead of the absolute superlative. So, `centralissimo` is the same as `molto centrale`.

## Indirect object pronouns
To **find out** who likes something you say `A chi?` (To whom?).

```
A chi piacciono gli appartamenti bui?
```

In order to **describe** who likes something, we use the so-called indirect object pronouns. These answer the question `A chi?` (To whom?).

```
Mi piacciono gli apartamenti luminosi.
Gli piace molto Roma.
```

The verb `piacere` uses indirect object pronouns. There are other verbs that also use indirect object pronouns, but there is no hard and fast rule. Instead, these verbs just need to be learnt by heart.

### Unstressed object pronouns
```
io - mi
tu - ti
lui - gli
lei, Lei - le, Le
noi - ci
voi - vi
loro - gli, loro
```

`Loro` always comes after the verb, whilst `gli` comes before.

### Stressed object pronouns
The stressed object pronoun can be used to emphasize to whom the verb is being applied, especially if there is a contrast that the speaker wants to highlight. Note that the stressed form of the object pronoun **always** comes after a preposition and that `anche` is always followed by `a` + the stressed object pronoun.

```
A me piace quest'appartamento, a lui no.
Anche a te piacciono le stanze luminose?
```

## Piacere

`Piacere` (to like, to please) can be used to express what you like or enjoy doing. The form `piace` (3rd pers. sg.) is used when referring to a person or a thing that you like.

Use the form `piacciono` (3rd pers. pl.) when talking about several people or things that you like.
