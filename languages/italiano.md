## The absolute superlative
The ending `-issimo` is added to adjectives in order to express the *highest* level of that attribute or characteristic. This is known as **the absolute superlative**.

The form of the absolute superlative used modulates the end of the superlative to match the gender and number of the noun being described.

```
Questo porto e buonisimo.
Vivono in centro perch√© sono ricchissimi.
```

Where the plural of the adjective ending in `co` becomes `chi`, you add an `h` in the superlative as well.

```
antico - antichissimo
lungo - lunghissimo
```

It's also possible to use the form `molto (very) + adjective` instead of the absolute superlative. So, `centralissimo` is the same as `molto centrale`.
