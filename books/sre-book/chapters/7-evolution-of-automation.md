# The Evolution of Automation at Google
## Overview
Automation is a very powerful tool that can be applied judiciously to certain situations to lessen the operational burden experienced by humans.

## The Value of Automation
### Consistency
Any task that must be performed repeatedly by human beings will ultimately be undertaken with slight variance depending on who is performing the task and how they are approaching it. This lack of consistency inevitably leads to mistakes and oversights that can and do translate into reliability issues. In this regard, the execution of well-scoped, known procedures in a consistent fashion is the primary value of automation.

### A Platform
In addition to consistency, well-designed automatic system can be designed in such a way that they become an extensible platform, upon which different types of problems can be solved. The tasks that solve these problems can also be performed rapidly, ad infinitum, without fatigue or mistakes, and can be easily measured for efficiency and robustness.

### Faster Repairs
Automation can also be leverage to proactively root out or remedy common issues that arise in the operation of a service, ultimately reducing the time it takes to detect and repair issues. The less time spent repairing issues, the more velocity product teams can spend developing the product.

### Faster Action
In general, machines are far more effective at identifying and reacting to well-defined issues that would likely take humans far longer to respond to, such a traffic switching or failover procedures. 

### Time Saving
Tasks that are automated can be executed by anyone in the organization without any specialized knowledge or much fear of performing the task incorrectly. In this way, the time saved is applicable across an entire organization and not just for the engineer or engineers that implement the automation.

## The Use Case for Automation
The term **automation** is used to cover a wide range of problems, but is primarily seen as a sort of "meta-software" in the sense that it is software that acts upon software.

Automation usually follows an evolution that progresses as the need for the automation is uncovered and developed.

1. No automation
2. Externally maintained system-specific automation
3. Externally maintained generic automation
4. Internally maintained system-specific automation
5. Systems that automatically heal themselves

Automation processes can vary in three vectors:

- **Competence** (i.e. Their accuracy)
- **Latency** (i.e. The time taken to execute)
- **Relevance** (i.e. Proportion of real-world use cases covered)

When the team using the automation is not the same team responsible for maintaining it the processes often suffer from drift during which the process become incompetent, high-latency, and irrelevant.
