# Preamble
## Foreword
- Humans are merely a part, albeit overweight, of then natural world and as such are dependent on it for oxygen, water, food, clothes, etc. Everything that we have comes from nature.
- **Everything is interconnected.** Poverty, homelessness, hunger, etc. are all related to the climate crisis. A species cannot be saved unless its habitat is preserved, and the habitat cannot be preserved without the participation of local communities. If these communities are facing immediate, existential crises themselves be it poverty, hunger, etc. they cannot participate in the larger narrative.

## Regeneration
- **Regeneration** means putting life at the center of every action and decision.
- The causes of the climate crisis are many: cars, buildings, wars, deforestation, poverty, oil, corruption, coal, industrial agriculture, overconsumption, fracking, and more. All of these are the byproducts of the advancement of humanity.
- These causes are largely produced by the financial system we promote which has primarily invested in _planetary liquidation_ or biological depletion, poverty and inequality in exchange for monetary wealth.
- The near term solutions to reversing climate change are drawing down **carbon dioxide** from the atmosphere and sequestering it here on Earth. The long term solutions will require fundamental shifts in system thinking and institutions, but it can be done. The current system is largely _extractive_, but it can be changed to be _regenerative_.

## Agency
- Ending the climate crisis is no small task, but it can be achieved by course correcting society to be going the right direction at the right speed by 2030 with a target of zero net emissions by 2050.
- Reversing the climate crisis is an outcome of the much larger endeavor of rejuvenating human health, security, and well-being.

## How to Use This Book
- The concept of regeneration is not about fighting, combating, or mitigating the climate crisis. Regeneration is about healing, building, and creating. The goal is to get the masses of disengaged people in the world, and get them involved. This requires addressing current human n
- The book touches on _six_ different frameworks outlining actions that can be taken to solve the climate crisis. They overlap in many ways, but each category holds multiple levels of discovery, innovation, and breakthrough.
- **Equity.** This is the first framework since it encompasses everything. The root of equity is the belief that our environment is a direct reflection of the state of our society. The violence, injustice, disrespect, and harm we do to each other disconnects us from others and speeds the deterioration of the planet. We cannot engage others if they are lacking.
- **Reduce.** Reducing the amount of greenhouse gases we emit is the most straight-forward and also the most difficult approach to solving the climate crisis.
- **Protect.** The Earth is naturally built to capture and sequester greenhouse gases, but it cannot do that if nature is not preserved. Terrestrial systems hold a staggering **3,300 billion** tons of carbon in and above ground, which is 4x the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. By destroying it, we release carbon and diminish the future capacity.
- **Sequester.** Almost 25% of our carbon emissions are absorbed by the oceans, with much of it being turned into carbonic acid. This acid is slowly killing sea life and creating dead oceans across the world.
- **Influence.** This is framework discusses the various levels of influence from global to local that individuals can have to contribute to solving the climate crisis.
- **Support.** There are a ton of organizations already working on these problems that can use support from individuals. This extends beyond the climate and into social justice and impact.
