# Oceans
## Key Takeaways
- **Acidification**. The decrease in pH that occurs when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in seawater. This process _removes_ carbonate ions from the water, which many rely upon to survive, most notably phytoplankton.
- **30-by-30 Approach**. Scientists believe that designating 30% of our oceans as Marine Protected Areas by 2030 will have a significant impact on the number of fish, the sequestration of carbon, and the oxygen created via phytoplankton.
- Successful MPAs are absolute no-take zones, measuring at least 40 square miles, that are maintained for a minimum of 10 years.
- One of the most prolific organizations promoting MPAs is the [Pristine Ocean Project](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/pristine-seas/) founded by Enric Sala and sponsored by National Geographic.
- **Seaforestation**. The process of seeding kelp in nearby waters where they would not naturally occur.
- **Nutrient Bioextraction**. The process of removing pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorous from ecosystems via consumption by biological processes (e.g. growing kelp).
- **Phytoremediation**. A term that refers to the use of plants for environmental cleanup.

## Introduction
- Oceans can absorb the greatest impact of human activity on the planet, yet receive the least coverage.
- 10% of the population is directly dependent on fisheries while another three billion rely on the sea for at least 20% of their protein intake.
- Oceans are easily the largest carbon sink on the planet with **12x** more carbon than the land and **45x** as much carbon as the atmosphere.
- The oceans have absorbed 93% of the atmospheric heating and 25% of the carbon dioxide emitted. As a result, oceans are undergoing a process known as acidification in which the pH balance decreases due to the absorption of carbon dioxide in seawater.
- The process of **deepwater formation** is the process of carbon dioxide rich seawater sinking to the depths of the ocean, where it enters currents and is eventually consumed, cycled, and sequestered by sea life.

## Marine Protected Areas
- Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are incredibly important in allowing the profound regenerative powers of the ocean to operate unhindered.
- There is a psychological phenomenon referred to as _"shifting baselines"_ that describes the adaptation of expectations as new normals are established. This phenomenon reminds me of the adage of the frog in the boiling pot.
- Different MPAs have different functions. Some are created with the intention of bolstering fish populations outside their boundaries through "spillover," while others are designed to capture and sequester carbon. The latter are primarily onshore.
- Near coastal MPAs are referred to as _green ocean_, while those in deeper waters are referred to as _blue ocean_.
- Successful MPAs are well protected and strictly designated as **no-take zones**. This means no extraction _of any kind_, but specifically fishing, and specifically of keystone species, like sharks and otters. 
- In nations where much of the economy is derived from the ocean, other forms of income must e developed. One possibility is to employ locals to patrol and protect the MPAs similar to park rangers.
- Successful MPAs must also be relatively sizable, with most exceeding _40 square miles_ due to migration patterns of fish, fingerlings, and larvae.
- Successful MPAs also require time to restore and regenerate with _10 years_ being the most often cited healing period.
- The high seas yield a measly 2.4% of total seafood production and only 4.2% of the total global fish catch, which is largely driven by demand from luxury markets in food-secure countries and is fished by heavily subsidized and fossil fuel hungry fleets. There is data that shows if the high seas were closed to fishing, the yield of onshore fishing would more than compensate for the closures.
- Protecting 30% of oceans by 2030 is a triple win, including increased fish populations, restored biodiversity, and secured carbon.

## Seaforestation
- One square foot of healthy macroalgae draws down more than 2 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.
- The disappearance of sea otters along the California coast has led to the creation of sea urchin barrens, which erode the sea kelp anchor points and ultimately kill off large swaths of sea forests.
- **Seaforestation**. The process of seeding kelp in nearby waters where they would not naturally occur.
- Targeting nutrient rich runoff as areas for seaforestation is a win-win since both macro- and microalgae require nitrogen and phosphorous as key nutrients. They extract these pollutants from waterways through a process called nutrient bioextraction.
- Red algae, including _Asparagopsis_, dramatically reduces the impact of methane emissions created by livestock. By replacing just 0.5 - 5% of cattle grazing with _Asparagopsis_ the methane produced from livestock is reduced by a whopping 50 - 99%.
- Seaforestation also has the potential to create tons of jobs, especially for those in areas that are traditionally economically deficient.
- This is such a cost-effective way of healing the Earth that the Climate Foundation has adopted the unofficial motto "The First Gigaton is on Us," implying that they can cover the cost of drawing down an entire gigaton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere simply through the growing and selling of kelp and red algae products.
- Currently, only 11% of carbon is deposited into cold storage in the ocean depths, but that is because only a small fraction of kelp finds its way there. Through seaforrestation we could deliberately sink 90% of the carbon from harvested kelp.
- Seaforrestation requires four conditions: anchoring sites, sunlight, cool water, and lots of nutrients.
- The ocean is stratified into two main layers, the first of which is often nutrient deficient and warm, while the latter is incredibly nutrient dense and much cooler, making for perfect conditions for growth.
- Many seaforresters see their main job as raising the cool, nutrient dense water to the surface using renewable energy. This would create sea oases in the middle of vast expanses of empty ocean, creating natural upwelling. The Climate foundation calls this process _irrigation_.

## Mangroves
- Mangrove forests remove up to 4x as much carbon from the atmosphere as terrestrial forests and can store up to 2x as much carbon. Mangrove forests currently hold between 5.6 - 6.1 billion tons of carbon worldwide, primarily in their soil.
- The world has lost nearly 50% of all mangrove ecosystems since 1980 primarily due to landscape conversion, illegal logging, and coastal development.
- When mangroves are destroyed they release massive carbon stores that took millennia to store, in a matter of years, turning a significant carbon store into a carbon source.

## Seagrasses
- Seagrasses are much like their terrestrial cousins, having leaves, roots, blossoms, and seeds.
- Seagrass meadows account for less than 0.1% of the ocean area while providing 20% of the largest fish nurseries and 10% of carbon sequestration each year.
- Seagrasses are highly endangered with only 45 - 150 million acres surviving today. Over 12 million acres have been decimated in the past century.
- The greatest threat to seagrasses is pollution and the resulting poor water quality.

## Azolla Fern
- Azolla ferns have a huge capacity for carbon sequestration in addition to providing an alternative to fossil-fuel intensive fertilizers, animal feed, and biofuel.
- Azolla grows as a coin-size rosette on the surface of freshwater with delicate roots dangling in the water.
- It acts as a "biofertilizer," meaning it provides nutrients to the rest of its ecosystem and is believed to transfer nitrogen directly into the water in which it grows.
- Growing azolla alongside rice increases yields by 50 - 200% and dramatically reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.
- Growing azolla in dedicated ponds creates a renewable supply of green fertilizer for other crops.
- Eggs laid by chickens fed azolla contain the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA.
- Early trial suggest an acre of azolla could concurrently produce as much ethanol as an acre of corn and as much biodiesel as an acre of palm oil, all without energy-intensive nitrogen fertilizers.
- Great care needs to be taken when introducing azolla into ecosystems though, since some species have become invasive.
