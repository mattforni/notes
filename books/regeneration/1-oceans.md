# Oceans
## Key Takeaways
- **Acidification**. The decrease in pH that occurs when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in seawater. This process _removes_ carbonate ions from the water, which many rely upon to survive, most notably phytoplankton.
- **30-by-30 Approach**. Scientists believe that designating 30% of our oceans as Marine Protected Areas by 2030 will have a significant impact on the number of fish, the sequestration of carbon, and the oxygen created via phytoplankton.
- Successful MPAs are absolute no-take zones, measuring at least 40 square miles, that are maintained for a minimum of 10 years.
- One of the most prolific organizations promoting MPAs is the [Pristine Ocean Project](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/pristine-seas/) founded by Enric Sala and sponsored by National Geographic.

## Introduction
- Oceans can absorb the greatest impact of human activity on the planet, yet receive the least coverage.
- 10% of the population is directly dependent on fisheries while another three billion rely on the sea for at least 20% of their protein intake.
- Oceans are easily the largest carbon sink on the planet with **12x** more carbon than the land and **45x** as much carbon as the atmosphere.
- The oceans have absorbed 93% of the atmospheric heating and 25% of the carbon dioxide emitted. As a result, oceans are undergoing a process known as acidification in which the pH balance decreases due to the absorption of carbon dioxide in seawater.
- The process of **deepwater formation** is the process of carbon dioxide rich seawater sinking to the depths of the ocean, where it enters currents and is eventually consumed, cycled, and sequestered by sea life.

## Marine Protected Areas
- Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are incredibly important in allowing the profound regenerative powers of the ocean to operate unhindered.
- There is a psychological phenomenon referred to as _"shifting baselines"_ that describes the adaptation of expectations as new normals are established. This phenomenon reminds me of the adage of the frog in the boiling pot.
- Different MPAs have different functions. Some are created with the intention of bolstering fish populations outside their boundaries through "spillover," while others are designed to capture and sequester carbon. The latter are primarily onshore.
- Near coastal MPAs are referred to as _green ocean_, while those in deeper waters are referred to as _blue ocean_.
- Successful MPAs are well protected and strictly designated as **no-take zones**. This means no extraction _of any kind_, but specifically fishing, and specifically of keystone species, like sharks and otters. 
- In nations where much of the economy is derived from the ocean, other forms of income must e developed. One possibility is to employ locals to patrol and protect the MPAs similar to park rangers.
- Successful MPAs must also be relatively sizable, with most exceeding _40 square miles_ due to migration patterns of fish, fingerlings, and larvae.
- Successful MPAs also require time to restore and regenerate with _10 years_ being the most often cited healing period.
- The high seas yield a measly 2.4% of total seafood production and only 4.2% of the total global fish catch, which is largely driven by demand from luxury markets in food-secure countries and is fished by heavily subsidized and fossil fuel hungry fleets. There is data that shows if the high seas were closed to fishing, the yield of onshore fishing would more than compensate for the closures.
- Protecting 30% of oceans by 2030 is a triple win, including increased fish populations, restored biodiversity, and secured carbon.
