# Fat: It's Not All Bad
## Overview
- Fat is a necessary and important macronutrient that is responsible for protecting organs, absorbing nutrients, producing hormones, supporting cell growth, and providing energy.
- Fat is the second most preferred energy source just after carbohydrates. It is an especially important energy source for endurance athletes, who tune their bodies to utilize fat as the primary fuel source.
- Fat is the most calorie-dense macronutrient, containing **9 calories per gram**. This means if a serving of food has 10 grams of fat, 90 calories in that serving are from fat.
- Fat is not bad in itself, but **the source of fat is important to consider since some fat sources have little to no nutritional value**. This is especially true of oils and the hydrogenated fats often found in processed foods.
- When too many calories come from fat those calories tend to crowd out the nutritional benefits of the other foods.
- The rule of thumb is that **fat should only be a supporting character on your plate**. It is a "condiment food" versus the main event. A reasonable target for fat intake is between 15 - 25% of daily calories depending on activity and needs.
- Limit saturated fats to less than 5% of daily caloric intake, ideally originating from a healthy source like coconut, and keep trans fat ingestion as close to zero as possible. Target an omega-6 to omega-3 fat intake ratio of 4:1 to 3:1.
- **Oils are calorie-dense but nutrient-sparse. Opt for their wholefood equivalents when possible**!

## Types of Fat
There type and source of fat is incredibly important. There are four main types of dietary fat.

### Monounsaturated Fats
Monounsaturated fats are made up of **omega-9 essential fatty acids** (EFAs). These EFAs **can** be produced by the body, so it is not necessary to acquire them via diet.

The benefits of consuming monounsaturated fats include:
- decreased inflammation
- improved insulin sensitivity
- increased "good" HDL cholesterol
- decreased "bad" LDL cholesterol
- reduced risk of heart attack and stroke

The best plant-based sources of omega-9s are:
- nuts (e.g. almonds, cashews, walnuts)
- avocados
- chia seeds
- coconut

### Polyunsaturated Fats
Polyunsaturated fats include **omega-3 and omega-6 EFAs**. These fats **must** be acquired through diet since the body cannot produce them on its own. The only catch is the ratio in which omega-3 and omega-6 fats are consumed.

Omega-6 fats are primarily used for energy and are crucial for biological function, but they are abundant in oil and other processed foods, often leading to overconsumption.

Omega-3 fats are much less common, often leading to under consumption. These EFAs are critical for cellular health including:
- manufacturing healthy cell membranes,
- improving heart health,
- boosting mental health and mood stability
- aiding weight loss
- contributing to brain development
- reducing inflammation
- preventing dementia
- promoting bone health
- decreasing liver fat

The ideal ration of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is 4:1, or even 3:1, but the average is much higher, in the realm of 10:1 and worse. This imbalance increases the risks of cardiovascular disease and other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

The best plant-based sources of omega-6s are:
- tofu
- walnuts
- almonds
- cashews
- peanut butter
- sunflower seeds
- hemp-seeds
- pumpkin seeks
- whole-grain breads

The best plant-based sources of omega-3s are:
- walnuts
- hemp-seeds
- chia seeds
- flaxseeds
- tofu
- navy beans
- brussels sprouts
- avocados
- flaxseed oil
- fortified foods like soy beverages

### Saturated Fats
In general, saturated fats should not be targets as a way to add fat to a diet since they raise the level of LDL cholesterol, increasing risk of heart attack and stroke. That said, a small percentage of the daily intake, around 5%, should be made up of saturated fats since shorter chains of fats are easily digested and deliver an array of health benefits:
- improving brain and memory function
- increasing energy and endurance,
- lowering blood sugar and cholesterol
- encouraging weight loss

A healthy source of saturated fat is coconut, which also contains **medium-chain triglycerides** (MCTs).

### Trans Fats
Trans fat are prevalent in some naturally occurring animal-based foods, as well as many highly processed foods, specifically hydrogenated vegetable oils. **This type of fat should be avoided**.
