# Part 1: The Pursuit of Pleasure
## Chapter 1: Our Masturbation Machines
- The brain processes pleasure and pain in the same place.
- Pleasure and pain act as two sides of a scale with craving occurring when the scale is tipped toward the side of pain.
- The term *"double life"* is commonplace in psychology, usually referring to a person struggling with addiction and their secret engagement with their compulsive behaviors.
- *Addiction* is defined as the continued and compulsive consumption of substance or behavior **despite** its harm to self and/or others.
- Most people experience some form of addiction today, even when their lives are good.
- A *Skinner box*, also known as an operant conditioning chamber, is a laboratory apparatus designed to study and reinforce behavior through conditioning via reward and punishment.
- One of the biggest risk factors for addiction is easy access. The easier a drug or behavior is to access the higher the likelihood for addition.
- Taking drugs can lead to epigenetic changes, which are *heritable* changes to the strands of DNA.
- The act of consumption itself has become the drug in modern society. The Internet is the largest contributor to compulsive overconsumption by providing increased and consistent access as well as *suggesting* new behaviors that may not have occurred organically.
- **70%** of world global death are attributable to modifiable behavioral risk factors.

## Chapter 2: Running from Pain
- We are all avoiding discomfort. Often at all costs.
- The pursuit of personal happiness has become the ultimate modern maxim with even acts of kindness being performed for personal happiness rather than in the name of altruism.
- As a society we have become hyper-focused on the self and have lost the sense of the collective that used to bind us.
- Religion used to serve as a means of promoting the collective, but it has become less prevalent in society and been replaced in many instances with the *"God Within"*.
- Different from previous generations in which children were considered miniature adults, modern children are often coddled and helicopter parents avoid making demands to avoid stressing or traumatizing children.
- Frailty and fragility of the young is a new and self-fulfilling prophecy that begets increasingly maladjusted generations.
- We have overcorrected for some barbary of the past by spending an overwhelming amount of time discussing triggers and safe spaces. Not to say that those conversations are not valuable, but everything in moderation.
- Lembke expresses her worry that "we have both oversanitized and overpathologized childhood, raising our children in the equivalent of a padded cell, with no way to injure themselves but also no means to ready themselves for the world."
- The result is a generation that is "less tolerant, more entitled, and ignorant of their own character defects."
- The result is also a generation stuck on the hedonic treadmill, fueled by medication, distraction, and overconsumption in the name of the pursuit of happiness.
- We are no longer able to tolerate any discomfort, instead developing an insatiable appetite for distraction and avoidance.
- *Boredom* is one of those negative emotions from which many flee, due to the fact that it can force one to come address their behavior and contemplate their purpose.
- It may very well be that in attempting to avoid being uncomfortable we are making ourselves miserable.
