# Part 2: Self-Binding 

## Chapter 4: Dopamine Fasting
The framework Lembke uses for discussing compulsive overconsumption is easily remembered by the acronym `DOPAMINE`.

### `D` for `Data`
Gathering simple facts about the current consumption.

### `O` for `Objectives`
Understanding the motivation and reasoning behind the consumption. Assert that the consuming is "doing something positive." This can be relieving boredom, managing fear, anxiety, insomnia, depression, etc.

### `P` for `Problems`
Garnering and understanding of the perceived downsides of consuming. High-dopamine drugs almost *always* lead to problems, whether they be related to health, relationships, morals, etc. Most people caught in the compulsive overconsumption hamster wheel are unable to see the full extent of the consequences, while still using.

Neuroscientist Daniel Friedman said "The world is sensory rich and casual poor," which is to say that we lean toward the immediate despite knowing the longer term effects.

### `A` for `Abstinence`
Abstinence is a necessary step in restoring homeostasis and in allowing the pleasure-pain scale to reclaim an even balance and restore normal reward pathways. The typical effective detox period is four weeks. At two weeks, patients are usually still in a *dopamine deficit state* and are experiencing withdrawal.

In most cases of compulsive overconsumption where clinical depression is involved, the depression was abated if not fully alleviated, after a period of abstinence indicating that the addiction caused the depression and not the other way around.

### `M` for `Mindfulness`
Lembke defines mindfulness as "simply the ability to observe what our brain is doing while it's doing it, without judgement." Mindfulness is a practice in which an individual views their thoughts and emotions objectively, as simultaneously separate and part of the self.

As soon as an individual starts condemning what their brain is doing, they stop being able to objectively observe and mindfulness is lost.

### `I` for `Insight`
The exercise of abstaining from the drug of choice for at least four weeks is meant to give time and space to generate clarifying insight.

### `N` for `Next Steps`
Some emerging evidence suggests that *some* people who previously met the criteria for addiction can return to using their drug of choice in a controlled manner, but for the most part continued abstinence is the outcome.

### `E` for `Experiment`
For some with severe addiction the goal of moderation can backfire in a precipitous rise in compulsive overconsumption after a period of abstinence. This phenomenon is known as the **abstinence violation effect**. That said, there are some high-dopamine situations that are tough to avoid (e.g. eating, communication and networking, etc.), so experimenting with how to moderate and incorporate these activities in a healthy way is paramount to the completion of the framework.

## Space, Time, and Meaning
**Self-binding** is a way to "intentionally and willingly create barriers between ourselves and our drug of choice in order to mitigate compulsive overconsumption." Self-binding is often employed as a means of restriction when will power is depleted and is performed in recognition of the limitations of will.

By creating tangible barriers there, whether physical, temporal, or otherwise, an individual gives pause to the cycle of consumption between the desire catalyst and the action response. It is important to note that on occasion the act of "solving the puzzle" created by the self-binding becomes part of the appeal of consuming the drug of choice. The impediment becomes an inviting challenge to be overcome.

Self-binding methodologies are easily divided categorically into three categories:

1. physical strategies (space)
2. chronological strategies (time)
3. categorical strategies (meaning)

### Physical Self-Binding
**Physical self-binding** is the act of creating literal physical and/or geographical barriers between the self and the drug of choice. This can be anything from throwing away the drug of choice to imbibing pharmacological substances that prevent the binding of certain endogenous opioids.

### Chronological Self-Binding
**Chronological self-binding** is the use of time limits and finish lines to restrict consumption. This can be only allowing consumption during certain times of days, weeks, months, etc., which limits the window of consumption, ideally limiting overall consumption. This can also be a binding based on milestones or accomplishments (e.g. after a final exam, end of quarter, etc.).

Interestingly, there is an ideal time window, which when exceeded has been observed to lead to increased self-administration. Thus, self-binding time windows must be sufficiently narrow in order to be effective.

Short of actual limitation, tracking the amount of time spent on consumption can serve as a means of instilling awareness and mitigating consumption.

### The Erosion of Delayed Gratification 
The concept of **delay discounting** describes the effect of high-dopamine substances eroding the ability to delay gratification. This is a phenomenon in which the value of a reward decreases the longer that an individual has to wait to receive it. Addiction increases exposure to high-dopamine substances, which decreases sensitivity to normal rewards, especially delayed rewards, and ultimately leads to a diminished "temporal horizon." In other words, addiction and high-dopamine substances beget short term thinking and a proclivity toward immediate gratification.

When individuals delay gratification, the prefrontal cortex is activated. This is the part of the brain that is involved in planning and abstract thinking. Modern society primes individuals to expect and seek immediate gratification, which in turn means we are all not vulnerable to prefrontal cortical atrophy.

Adding to the issue is the substantial increase in leisure time available to most in the modern world. Leisure time has increased by **5.1 hours per week** between 1965 and 2003, which equated to a staggering **additional 270 leisure hours per year**. Much of this time is now filled with activities that contribute to dopamine consumption, which is also a backdoor reason why some opt not to participate in the workforce.

### Categorical Self-Binding
**Categorical self-binding** attempts to limit the consumption of dopamine by sorting it into different categories and sub-categories, some of which are allowed, while others are not. The motivation behind categorical self-binding is to not only limit exposure to the drug of choice, but also to the triggers associated with it, which is especially help for substances that cannot be fully eliminated (e.g. food, sex, and smartphones). It is paramount to ensure that *all* triggers are included in the list of unacceptable activities.

One example is the elevation of mind-altering drugs to sacred categories, whereby they may only be administered by a priest, shaman, etc.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, binding ourselves is a way to reassert our freedom. The act of imposing governance upon ourselves in an expression of freedom.
