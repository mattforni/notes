# Conclusion
It is only natural to seek respite from a world that is becoming increasingly more demanding while at the same time offering readily accessible pleasure in heretofore unimaginable quantities. Seeking solace in addictive drugs and behaviors soothes in the short term, but contributes to problems in the long term, and yet there is an epidemic of oblivion seeking in modern society.

If instead we turn toward the world and truly immerse ourselves in it, we can foster a much more holistic experience and live a much more fulfilled life, full of intimate relationships and enjoyment.

7. Beward of getting addicted to pain.
8. Radical honesty promotes awareness, enhanced intimacy, and fosters a plenty mindset.
