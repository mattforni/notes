# This Naked Mind Notes
## Introduction
- Alcohol is a *dangerous* and *addictive* drug akin to nicotine, cocaine, and heroin. Thinking of it as drugs *and alcohol* where alcohol is in a category all its own is a delusion.
- There are innumerable rationalizations for why society endorses alcohol. Some of these rationalizations are to relieve stress, engage socially, or liven up a party.
- Alcohol makes no distinctions in terms of who and how it impacts. Often times the strongest, smartest, and most successful people are the most affected.

## 1. This Naked Mind: How and Why it Works
- **unconscious:** *un·con·scious* | /ənˈkänSHəs/ noun. The part of the mind that a person is not aware of but that is a powerful force in controlling behavior.
- The unconscious mind is responsible for and in control of all desires and is an overwhelmingly powerful force in controlling behavior.
- Change usually begins with a conscious thought, but requires altering unconscious beliefs and assumptions to truly take root. This can be achieved by educating the conscious mind.
- "Unconscious learning happens automatically and unintentionally through experiences, observations, conditioning, and practice."
- The mind is capable of burying morally reprehensible thoughts and even masking these thoughts by causing physical pain to distract through a process known as **amplification**. This process prevents "unacceptable" ideas from being examined and realized.
- The unconscious has no rationality. It is the domain of emotions and desires and is governed accordingly. When a conscious decision is made that conflicts with the emotions and desires harbored by the unconscious a cognitive dissonance is created.
- Society has conditioned the unconscious mind to believe alcohol provides pleasure, enjoyment, and support. In doing so it has entrenched alcohol in both social and stressful situations.
- Belief is built upon a foundation of `Experiences & Observations`. `Assumptions` are made from those `Experiences & Observations`. `Conclusions` are drawn from the `Assumptions`. `Conclusions` are drawn from the `Assumptions`. And finally `Beliefs` are formed out of the `Conclusions` that are reached, forming a self-specific semblance of reality.

- `Beliefs` are defined by [Dave Gray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davegray/) to be the "things we know to be true", but these "things" are just an interpretation, a facsimile of reality, filtered through the layers listed above.
- Humans also tend to seek out `Experiences and Observations` that align with their beliefs, making those beliefs "self-sealing". This phenomenon is known as **confirmation bias.**
- Humans also attempt to protect their beliefs by consciously and unconsciously rejecting ideas that are incongruent to their beliefs. This rejection often does not allow for the testing and assimilation of new information that contradicts previously held beliefs.
- Bringing unconscious `Experiences and Observations` into the light of the conscious mind allows for the unconscious to change and assimilate these new experiences through the process of **neuroplasticity**.
- Alcohol is factually addictive. Full stop. It costs money, health, and relationships no matter who you are.

## 2. The Drinker or the Drink? Part 1: The Drinker
- The overwhelming sentiment in society is that the drinker is to blame for the inability to control drinking like "regular" drinkers. This inability is interpretted as a lack of willpower.
- Alcoholism is **not** defined by much or how often one drinks. There is no hard and fast definition for alcoholism.
- There are some loose correlations between genes and alcohol use, but there is no definitive causation behind those correlations.
- Since there is no specific, diagnosable defect of mind or body to which alcohol can be attributed it follows that **everyone** is susceptible to and on the path to alcohol dependence, albeit at different rates and with different experiences.
- A.A. touts the claim that alcoholism is a disorder or disease that they are powerless against. This claim allows for a separation between the addict and the "regular" drink that is mutually beneficial for both parties. "Regular" drinkers are able to use this belief as a buffer between their habits and those of the addicted, while addicts are able to place blame on their defect.

## 3. Part 2: The Drink
- In reality, alcohol is an addictive substance to which any human being can become addicted once enough has been consumed.
- This manifests in all drinkers through the systematic increasing of the amount of alcohol imbibed. Even the "regular" drinker often drinks more over long periods of time.
- Tolerance increases over time and with it the amount of alcohol needed to derive pleasure from the act of drinking.
- It stands that since alcohol is an addictive substance whose nature does not change based on who is drinking,
- and all humans are susceptible to addictive substances, that all humans are susceptible to alcohol addiction over a long enough period of sustained and increasing use.

## 4. Liminal Point: Is Drinking a Habit?
- "The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken." - Samuel Johnson
- It is impossible to grok and assimilate **all** `Experiences and Observations` so both are filtered through a lens of relevance with those `Experiences and Observations` deemed irrelevant filtered out of the things we use to create our `Assumptions`, `Conclusions`, and eventually `Beliefs`.
- By definition, habits encourage you to not actively engage in the activity being performed. This removes the need to **consciously** evaluate in the activity at hand.
- Individuals may habitually drink, but drinking is **not** a habit, but rather an addiction, which most individuals not actively participating in how much, or often they drink.
- The consumption of alcohol is fueled by a fear that a piece of the human experience is irrevocably tied to the act of drinking and that removing that act will cause a constant unease and will be replaced by an inevitable unhappiness.
