# This Naked Mind Notes
## Introduction
- Alcohol is a *dangerous* and *addictive* drug akin to nicotine, cocaine, and heroin. Thinking of it as drugs *and alcohol* where alcohol is in a category all its own is a delusion.
- There are innumerable rationalizations for why society endorses alcohol. Some of these rationalizations are to relieve stress, engage socially, or liven up a party.
- Alcohol makes no distinctions in terms of who and how it impacts. Often times the strongest, smartest, and most successful people are the most affected.

## 1. This Naked Mind: How and Why it Works
- **unconscious:** *un·con·scious* | /ənˈkänSHəs/ noun. The part of the mind that a person is not aware of but that is a powerful force in controlling behavior.
- The unconscious mind is responsible for and in control of all desires and is an overwhelmingly powerful force in controlling behavior.
- Change usually begins with a conscious thought, but requires altering unconscious beliefs and assumptions to truly take root. This can be achieved by educating the conscious mind.
- "Unconscious learning happens automatically and unintentionally through experiences, observations, conditioning, and practice."
- The mind is capable of burying morally reprehensible thoughts and even masking these thoughts by causing physical pain to distract through a process known as **amplification**. This process prevents "unacceptable" ideas from being examined and realized.
- The unconscious has no rationality. It is the domain of emotions and desires and is governed accordingly. When a conscious decision is made that conflicts with the emotions and desires harbored by the unconscious a cognitive dissonance is created.
- Society has conditioned the unconscious mind to believe alcohol provides pleasure, enjoyment, and support. In doing so it has entrenched alcohol in both social and stressful situations.
- Belief is built upon a foundation of `Experiences & Observations`. `Assumptions` are made from those `Experiences & Observations`. `Conclusions` are drawn from the `Assumptions`. `Conclusions` are drawn from the `Assumptions`. And finally `Beliefs` are formed out of the `Conclusions` that are reached, forming a self-specific semblance of reality.

- `Beliefs` are defined by [Dave Gray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davegray/) to be the "things we know to be true", but these "things" are just an interpretation, a facsimile of reality, filtered through the layers listed above.
- Humans also tend to seek out `Experiences and Observations` that align with their beliefs, making those beliefs "self-sealing". This phenomenon is known as **confirmation bias.**
- Humans also attempt to protect their beliefs by consciously and unconsciously rejecting ideas that are incongruent to their beliefs. This rejection often does not allow for the testing and assimilation of new information that contradicts previously held beliefs.
- Bringing unconscious `Experiences and Observations` into the light of the conscious mind allows for the unconscious to change and assimilate these new experiences through the process of **neuroplasticity**.
- Alcohol is factually addictive. Full stop. It costs money, health, and relationships no matter who you are.

## 2. The Drinker or the Drink? Part 1: The Drinker
- The overwhelming sentiment in society is that the drinker is to blame for the inability to control drinking like "regular" drinkers. This inability is interpretted as a lack of willpower.
- Alcoholism is **not** defined by much or how often one drinks. There is no hard and fast definition for alcoholism.
- There are some loose correlations between genes and alcohol use, but there is no definitive causation behind those correlations.
- Since there is no specific, diagnosable defect of mind or body to which alcohol can be attributed it follows that **everyone** is susceptible to and on the path to alcohol dependence, albeit at different rates and with different experiences.
- A.A. touts the claim that alcoholism is a disorder or disease that they are powerless against. This claim allows for a separation between the addict and the "regular" drink that is mutually beneficial for both parties. "Regular" drinkers are able to use this belief as a buffer between their habits and those of the addicted, while addicts are able to place blame on their defect.

## 3. Part 2: The Drink
- In reality, alcohol is an addictive substance to which any human being can become addicted once enough has been consumed.
- This manifests in all drinkers through the systematic increasing of the amount of alcohol imbibed. Even the "regular" drinker often drinks more over long periods of time.
- Tolerance increases over time and with it the amount of alcohol needed to derive pleasure from the act of drinking.
- It stands that since alcohol is an addictive substance whose nature does not change based on who is drinking,
- and all humans are susceptible to addictive substances, that all humans are susceptible to alcohol addiction over a long enough period of sustained and increasing use.

## 4. Liminal Point: Is Drinking a Habit?
- "The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken." - Samuel Johnson
- It is impossible to grok and assimilate **all** `Experiences and Observations` so both are filtered through a lens of relevance with those `Experiences and Observations` deemed irrelevant filtered out of the things we use to create our `Assumptions`, `Conclusions`, and eventually `Beliefs`.
- By definition, habits encourage you to not actively engage in the activity being performed. This removes the need to **consciously** evaluate in the activity at hand.
- Individuals may habitually drink, but drinking is **not** a habit, but rather an addiction, which most individuals not actively participating in how much, or often they drink.
- The consumption of alcohol is fueled by a fear that a piece of the human experience is irrevocably tied to the act of drinking and that removing that act will cause a constant unease and will be replaced by an inevitable unhappiness.

## 5. You: Simply Naked
- The body come fully equipped with two incredibly powerful guidance systems -- **symptoms** and **instincts** -- to help maintain homeostasis, defined as *"the maintenance of relatively stable internal physiological conditions (as body temperature or the pH of blood) in higher animals under fluctuating environmental conditions"*.
- **Symptoms** are the primary mechanism by which the body alerts the mind that some is not right, or out of homeostasis. The modern inclination is to dull these symptoms instead of heeding them, which can yield dangerous results.
- Humans are born with every instinct, hormone, and drug they need to live a long, healthy, and happy live.
- Pain is an incredibly important indicator of dangerous situations, but is often avoided at all costs. Pain keeps us from engaging in behaviors and doing things that could result in injury or even death.
- Repeated exposure to alcohol results in chronic fatigue and the normalization of stress and unhappiness. When compulsively drinking it is often challenging to manage stressful situations, resulting in the compounding of stress. 
- **Instincts** help us heed the symptoms, making sense of them and steering us clear of behaviors and situations that are harmful. Often these instincts are ignored in favor of using "intellect" to rationalize and explain away the instinctual response.
- Consuming alcohol and other drugs that deaden the ability to perceive symptoms and heed instinctual responses is reckless and can lead to dangerous situations and behaviors.

## 6. Liminal Point: Are We Really Drinking for the Taste?
- Early in life it is common to **observe** others seeming to enjoy the act of drinking, including the taste.
- Early **experience** was likely contradictory to this observation since alcohol is ethanol and is naturally unappealing to humans.
- But since the continued observation is that people seem to enjoy imbibing alcoholic drinks an **assumption** is formed that there must be something appealing about drinking.
- This yields a **conclusion** that drinking is a skill that must "be acquired," which is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
- Humans know they need food and water to live. Other animals do not have this cognitive faculty, so they rely on their instincts more heavily for survival. In general, animals are drawn to consume things that smell and taste good to them. They are repelled from things that smell and taste bad.
- Alcohol naturally tastes bad to humans, so we apply processes and mix it with sugar to make it more palatable. This does not change the nature of the drink, which is harmful in all forms.
- Over time and exposure the senses are dulled to the unpleasantness of all things, alcohol included.
- The claim that alcohol can be paired with food to enhance the flavor is one of the greatest marketing ploys ever executed. Most restaurants make the lion's share of their money from high margin items, like cocktails and wine. In reality, alcohol dulls the senses, reducing the enjoyment of the naturally pleasurable act of eating. No added enjoyment to be had. 
- A beer on a hot day may sound good, but that may be because alcohol is a *diuretic* which naturally dehydrates and increases thirst. The dehydration that occurs from drinking can actually end up shrinking the brain, drastically impairing the ability for the brain to function.

## 7. You: Polluted
- There are many *studies* about the dangers of alcohol consumption, but relatively few *articles* since touting the dangers of alcohol just does not sell copies of popular publications. Articles that promote the possible linkage between alcohol and health benefits are far more popular, despite being less credible. This is another form of confirmation bias.
- A study was performed to measure the harm of several drugs to both the direct user and the indirect people affected by the use. Alcohol score as **the most** harmful drug, with a score of 72, compared to heroin, which came in second at 55, and crack cocaine, coming in third with a score of 54.
- On average, alcohol causes **twice** as many deaths as **all other drugs, both illegal and prescription, combined** in the United States each year.
- The consumption of alcohol slows the pace of communication between neurotransmitters in the brain. The *cerebellum*, *limbic system*, and *cerebral cortex* are the most susceptible systems. These systems are responsible for motor coordination, memory, emotional response, activity (including planning and social interaction), problem-solving, and learning.
- Alcohol also artificially stimulates pleasure and reward pathways, diminishing the ability to derive enjoyment from activities that were once found enjoyable (e.g. seeing a friend, reading a book, and having sex).
- Just **one bout** of heavy drinking can cause considerable and long-lasting alterations in nerve cells and reduce the size of individual brain cells.
- The liver is the first line of defense against alcohol, but when it breaks down alcohol it releases toxins and damaged liver cells into the blood stream, which are more dangerous than the alcohol itself. These toxins and damaged cells cause bad sleep, mood imbalance, and a whole host of emotional deficiencies. During this process the liver also become inflamed and over time scar tissue forms on the liver, affecting its ability to function properly and mucking with metabolism.
- *Abstinence* has been shown to reverse these affects, with the affects fully self-correcting over the course of several months to a year.
- When the **circulatory system** is polluted with the toxins and damaged cells it becomes "dirty." These toxins weaken the heart to the point of sagging and stretching and can even cause irregularities in the electrical signals that are responsible for the contraction and expansion of the heart, which can lead to blood clots and up to a 39% increase in the chance of stroke.
- Imbibing alcohol also releases stress hormones that constrict blood vessels, raising blood pressure, and creating hypertension in the body. 
- Alcohol wreaks havoc on the immune system, suppressing both the innate and adaptive systems by disrupting the production of cytokines, which are key in detecting, messaging, and fighting off infection.
- Alcohol is a known carcinogen and is linked to a significantly increased probability of developing certain cancers when consumed in **any amount**.
- Early death from alcohol has been linked to the loss of **2,400,000** hours of human life in the United States alone, with alcoholism reducing life expectancy by 10 - 12 years on average.
